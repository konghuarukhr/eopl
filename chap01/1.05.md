Proof:

We say n-matched-parentheses(lc-exp) is the number of matched parentheses in lc-exp.  
The induction hypothesis, IH(k), is that any lc-exp of n-matched-parentheses(lc-exp) <= k has the same number of left and right parentheses.  

1. IH(0): e could be of the form *identifier*, which has the same number of left and right parentheses.
2. Let IH(k) holds, we show that IH(k+1) holds as well. n-matched-parentheses(e) <= k+1.
    * e could be of the form *(lambda (identifier) e1)*.
      Since n-matched-parentheses(e) <= k+1, n-matched-parentheses(e1) must <= k.
      Therefore e1 is covered by IH(k), and it has the same number of left and right parentheses, say n.
      Hence e has n+2 left parentheses and n+2 right parentheses.
    * e could be of the form *(e1 e2)*.
      Since n-matched-parentheses(e) <= k+1, n-matched-parentheses(e1) and n-matched-parentheses(e2) must <= k.
      Therefore e1 and e2 is covered by IH(k), and they have the same number of left and right parentheses, say n1 and n2 respectively,
      Hence e has n1+n2+1 left parentheses and n1+n2+1 right parentheses.

   IH(k+1) holds.
