If n=0, partial-vector-sum(v,n) returns v[0] (we know 0<length(v)), which is the sum of v from 0 to n.  
If n>0 and n<length(v)-1, partial-vector-sum(v,n) returns the sum of v from 0 to n,
then partial-vector-sum(v,n+1) returns v[n+1]+partial-vector-sum(v,n) (we know n+1<length(v)),
which is the sum of v from 0 to n+1.  
So, for all n >= 0 and n < length(v), partial-vector-sum(v,n) returns the sum of v from 0 to n.
