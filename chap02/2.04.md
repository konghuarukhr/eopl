(empty-stack) = <empty>
(push <f> val) = <g>, where (pop <g>) = <f> and  (top <g>) = val
(pop (push <f> val)) = <f>
(top (push <f> val)) = val
(empty-stack? stack) = true if stack is <empty> false otherwise
constructor: empty-stack, push
observer: top, pop, empty-stack?
I think pop maybe considered as constructor, as push.
